 * STL Vectors
 * _________________________________________________________
 * This program passes two arguments  to the function
 * with vector return type (lotto()). the first number is the 
 * number of the spots on a lottery card and the second is the 
 * number of spots selected at random. The program would assign
 * to winners a vector that contains six  numbers selected randomly
 * from range 1 through 51.
 * _________________________________________________________
 * INPUT: N/A
 *
 * OUTPUT: original deck of card, shuffled deck of card,
 * 		   the final deck of cards, the number of perfect
 * 		   shuffles needed to get back to original.
