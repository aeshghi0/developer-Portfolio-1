/****************************************************************
 * Perimeter and Area of shapes comparing using
 * overloading frined functions and class methods
 * ______________________________________________________________
 * This program prompts the user to input information for a
 * shape of square and a shape of triangle. then using the
 * virtual methods and inheritance of the classes, calculates
 * the perimeter and area of those shapes, then using the
 * frined class functions and class methods, the program
 * compares the area and perimeter of the squares with the
 * area and perimeter of the triangle. then outputs if any
 * attributes of these shapes were equal, then again promts the
 * user how many units they want to increase the length of both
 * shapes and again print outs the attribute of the shapes
 *
 *Also, using the try/catch blocks, the program determines if the
 *input numbers by the user are correct or no.
 * ______________________________________________________________
 * INPUT: square length, triangle sides
 *
 * OUTPUT: prints out the perimeter and area of the both shapes
 * 		   based on the information that the user put in, the
 * 		   result of the comparison of the attributes, and the
 * 		   new attributes after the modification

TRY BLOCK #1: 

Enter the length of 1st Square:-1

The side length: -1 is too small.
Please enter a value greater than 0.



Enter the length of 1st Square:55

The side length: 55 is too bog.
Please enter a value smaller than 50.



Enter the length of 1st Square:3

<<Valid side length input>>

Perimeter of Square is 12
Area of Square is 9
Enter the three sides of 1st triangle:


//this is just part of the output,just because 
//you said don't print out the output for assignment 
//6 and I assumed both of these outputs are going to be
//identical so I didn't copy and paste the whole output
