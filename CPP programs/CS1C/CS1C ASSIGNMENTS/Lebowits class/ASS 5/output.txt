/****************************************************************
 * Perimeter and Area of shapes comparing using
 * overloading frined functions and class methods
 * ______________________________________________________________
 * This program prompts the user to input information for a
 * shape of square and a shape of triangle. then using the
 * virtual methods and inheritance of the classes, calculates
 * the perimeter and area of those shapes, then using the
 * frined class functions and class methods, the program
 * compares the area and perimeter of the squares with the
 * area and perimeter of the triangle. then outputs if any
 * attributes of these shapes were equal, then again promts the
 * user how many units they want to increase the length of both
 * shapes and again print outs the attribute of the shapes
 *
 * ______________________________________________________________
 * INPUT: square length, triangle sides
 *
 * OUTPUT: prints out the perimeter and area of the both shapes
 * 		   based on the information that the user put in, the
 * 		   result of the comparison of the attributes, and the
 * 		   new attributes after the modification
