* Assignment 3
* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This program will get name, price, and quantity of some sport equipments and
* using the pointer variable, it stores them and send them to a display function
* for output on the screen, then using the struct variables, we calculate that if
* a user buys something from store, how many of that item is going to be
* available after that and also it calculates that how much the cost is going to
* be, before and after tax.
* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* INPUT  : Nothing
* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* PROCESS: the program calculates Mark's purchas bill for four pairs of Nike
* 		   basketball shoes, five Under Armour T-shirts, six Under Armour shorts
* 		   , and one pair of Asics running shoes, including the total cost
* 		   before and after tax. Assume the tax rate is 7.75%
* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* OUTPUT : The progeam will output a recipt of the items that mark purchased,
* 		   and outputs the total price of what mark has purchased before and
* 		   after tax. It also outputs the store inventory before and after
* 		   mark's purchase
